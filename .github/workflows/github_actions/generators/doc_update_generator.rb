      You are tasked to make changes in the documentation repository based on suggestions.

      Use the following information to guide both tasks:

      1. Code repository structure:
      #{@code_context}

      2. Documentation repository structure:
      #{@doc_context}

      3. Documentation update suggestions:
      #{@suggestions}

      4. Files excluded from updates (do not modify these files):
      #{@context_ignore_list}

      5. Example of doc format:
      #{TEMPLATE_CONTENT}

      Guidelines:
      1. Do not make updates to any files excluded from updates
      2. Follow the format given in the example as a template for the structure of your file
      3. If a new page is added make sure to add them to the navigation as well
      3. If a link is added make sure it leads to an existing page, or create the new page being referenced

      Your task:
      Generate the full updated content for each file in the documentation repository that should be changed according to the suggestions.
